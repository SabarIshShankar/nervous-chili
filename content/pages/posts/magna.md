##### Will the world ever change?&#xA;

##### Problems just don't have a set of perimeters, it sets it out to affect every corner of a sphere. Lists are defining each set of problems on various other platforms. From unemployment to poverty, everything is a deal. Graduates have to deal with the pressure of finding jobs, while companies that raise funding are firing people for no reason. Researches in solving mental health problems don't give an accurate solution. The common crowd, where everyone wants to do something different but all end up doing the same thing.

##### These obviously are the small thorns on the surface, there are a lot more inside. Medical science, biological research, and few on the list have been doing great. As far as it does good to humans and eradicates the hard problems of life, it good.

##### This article makes no sense, probably because life doesn't make sense too. As said problems everywhere, even in dreams. Have you not been able to dream without hitting a roadblock?

##### What should we learn from all the list of problems that the humans of the earth face? If anyone wants to solve a problem, it doesn't have to be the big ones, just clearing our minds and getting out of the struggle is great. If possible helping a few people, even better.

##### There's risk involved when you try to do something great, like changing the world. The Stupidity it is. The stupidity you see around you, not from you.
